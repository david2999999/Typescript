## TypeScript

TypeScript is a language for application-scale JavaScript. TypeScript adds optional types to JavaScript that support tools for large-scale JavaScript applications for any browser, for any host, on any OS. TypeScript compiles to readable, standards-based JavaScript. Try it out at the playground, and stay up to date via our blog and Twitter account.

* Optional static typing (the key here is optional)
* Type Inference, which gives some of the benefits of types, without actually using them
* Access to ES6 and ES7 features, before they become supported by major browsers
* The ability to compile down to a version of JavaScript that runs on all browsers
* Great tooling support with IntelliSense
